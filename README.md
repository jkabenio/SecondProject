I'd like to inform you that I am currently working on improving the coding style, readability, and overall quality of this codebase. My goal is to create a more maintainable and efficient codebase. These updates are being made to enhance code quality, consistency, and developer experience. I will be making regular updates over the next few months, focusing on aspects such as improving variable naming conventions, enhancing code comments and documentation, and adhering to my coding guidelines. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome and appreciated as I strive to make this codebase even better. Thank you for your understanding and support during this process.
